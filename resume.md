Experience
----------

**Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Peking University**

: Research Intern, October 2015 - August 2016, Beijing, China

* Worked on [knowledge base completion](https://github.com/liyouvane/Matrix-Factorization-for-Knowledgebase-Completion), which involves knowledge representation, matrix factorization and optimization methods.

* Used different matrix facorization methods to work on [recommender system](https://github.com/liyouvane/Matrix-Factorization-for-Recommender-System) related problems, and compared their performances.

* Built a search and broadcasting system for Olympic women volleyball competition with event extraction algorithms and designed a Weixin backstage interface system along with it.

**China Academy of Transportation Sciences**

: Data Analyst Intern, November 2015 - March 2016, Beijing, China

* Built a search and broadcasting system for Olympic women volleyball competition with event extraction algorithms and designed a Weixin backstage interface system along with it.

* Calculated traffic volume based on real time traffic status and used Matlab to build models describing the traffic status.

* Proposed solutions to improve traffic environment based on research results.

Projects
----------------

**Course Project, Prof.Jinwen Ma, Peking University**
: Intelligent Computation, September 2015 - January 2016

* Used ABC(Artificial Bees Colony) algorithm to recognize the ellipses in an given picture

* Utilized Particle Swarm Optimization and ABC to find the maximum and minimum values of Extended Powell Singular function and visualized the algorithms;

* Solved TSP problem through Artificial Ant Colony Algorithm and Differential Evolution Algorithm and tested a set of given data in two-dimensional case.

**Course Project, Prof.Kedian Mu, Peking University**
: Machine Learning, September 2015 - January 2016 

* Used multiple ways to classify data from UCI Machine Learning Repository, including KNN, CART, SVM and compare them from different aspects.

* Improved Boosting Algorithm by referring to the paper Improved Boosting Algorithms Using Confidence-rated Predictions and implemented three algorithms.

**Travel Management System, Prof.Meng Sun, Peking University**
: Mathematical Modeling, May 2014 - August 2014 

* Calculated the minimum cost between any two spots by using Dijkstra algorithm, the minimum cost of tracking all spots by dynamic programming and the minimum cost of Hamiltonian cycle by backtracking algorithm;

* Programmed Dijkstra algorithm with list structure in C language; Implemented Human-Computer Interaction allowing administrator or tourists to change data; Tested the stability of the system through large scales of data.

**Research on Modular Group, Prof.Yongbin Ruan, University of Michigan**
: Undergraduate Research Program, May 2014 - July 2014

* Read about Mathematical Physics related books and papers. Including Differential Geometry, Differential Manifold, PDE and reports on Spectral Theory of Laplace and Schrödinger Operators Workshop in 2013

* Found out three different methods to determine modular group of Picard-Fuchs equation, namely pure geometric, basing on Picard-Lefschetz Formula, and some basic integral skills. Wrote a paper named The Modular Group of Picard-Fuchs Equation in English.
