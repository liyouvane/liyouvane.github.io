Experience
----------

**Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Peking University**

: Research Intern, October 2015 - August 2016, Beijing, China

* Worked on [knowledge base completion](https://github.com/liyouvane/Matrix-Factorization-for-Knowledgebase-Completion), which involves knowledge representation, matrix factorization and optimization methods.

* Used different matrix facorization methods to work on [recommender system](https://github.com/liyouvane/Matrix-Factorization-for-Recommender-System) related problems, and compared their performances.

* Built a search and broadcasting system for Olympic women volleyball competition with event extraction algorithms and designed a Weixin backstage interface system along with it.

**China Academy of Transportation Sciences**

: Data Analyst Intern, November 2015 - March 2016, Beijing, China

* Built a search and broadcasting system for Olympic women volleyball competition with event extraction algorithms and designed a Weixin backstage interface system along with it.

* Calculated traffic volume based on real time traffic status and used Matlab to build models describing the traffic status.

* Proposed solutions to improve traffic environment based on research results.


**Department of Information Sciences, Peking University**

: Research Assistant, September 2015 - January 2016, Beijing, China

* Worked on bionic algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Algorithm, Differential Evolution Algorithm, etc. to solve TSP problem and compared their performances.

* Designed a pattern recognition system using ABC(Artificial Bees Colony) algorithm to recognize a certain pattern in given pictures.

* Learnt and used multiple ways to classify data from UCI Machine Learning Repository, including KNN, CART, SVM and compared them from different aspects.


Projects
----------------
**Find Out the Volleyball Champion**
: Python, HTML/CSS, mySQL, June 2016 - August 2016

* Crawled data about women volleyball players who are attending 2016 Olympic from official websites including their names, clubs, spike heights, block heights, etc.

* Designed an interaction backstage in Weixin application which can be easily accessed to inquire all the information for regular users anywhere and anytime.

* Designed a website along with students from Natural Language Processing group to extract information from data, compare players abilities and predict which team would be the winner automatically.

**A Better Course Scheduling System**
: C,C++, March 2014 - September 2014

* Designed and optimized a course scheduling model, analyzed the process of course-selection in our school and designed a more efficient way to arrange courses to satisfy students varied needs.

* Collected data from 180 students and tried out the new system within the department.

**Research on Modular Group, Prof.Yongbin Ruan, University of Michigan**
: Undergraduate Research Program, May 2014 - July 2014

* Read about Mathematical Physics related books and papers. Including Differential Geometry, Differential Manifold, PDE and reports on Spectral Theory of Laplace and Schrödinger Operators Workshop in 2013.

* Found out three different methods to determine modular group of Picard-Fuchs equation, namely pure geometric, basing on Picard-Lefschetz Formula, and some basic integral skills. Wrote a paper named The Modular Group of Picard-Fuchs Equation in English.

**A Traveling Management System**
: C,C++, February 2014 - May 2014 

* Calculated the minimum cost between any two spots by using Dijkstra algorithm, the minimum cost of tracking all spots by dynamic programming and the minimum cost of Hamiltonian cycle by backtracking algorithm.

* Programmed Dijkstra algorithm with list structure in C language; Implemented Human-Computer Interaction allowing administrator or tourists to change data; Tested the stability of the system through large scales of data.
